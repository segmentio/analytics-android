    params:
    - arg_name: priority
      api_field: scalingPolicy.priority

      help_text: |
        Priority of the Scaling Policy.

      help_text: |
        Deployment for this Scaling Policy.

        - arg_name: buffer-size
          api_field: scalingPolicy.fleetAutoscalerSettings.bufferSizeAbsolute
          help_text: |
            Size of a buffer of ready game server instances in absolute number.
        - arg_name: buffer-size-percent
          api_field: scalingPolicy.fleetAutoscalerSettings.bufferSizePercentage
          help_text: |
            Size of a buffer of ready game server instances in percentage.
        help_text: |
          Size of the buffer of ready game server instances in either absolute number or percentage.
          As game server instances get allocated or terminated, the fleet will be scaled up and down
          so that this buffer is maintained.

      help_text: |
        Minimum fleet size.

    - arg_name: schedule
      api_field: scalingPolicy.schedules
      help_text: |
        Event schedules. Schedules allow Scaling policies to be adjusted for planned events. For
        example, you can add policies to scale specific clusters during an event. This flag can
        be repeated.

        The following keys are allowed:

        *cron-spec*::: Cron definition of the scheduled event. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron.
        The cron spec specification is in the local time as defined by the realm. Requires
        cron-job-duration to be specified.

        *cron-job-duration*::: Duration for the cron job event. The duration of the event is effective
        after the cron job's start time. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on
        duration formats. Required if cron-spec is specified.

        *start-time*::: Start time of the event. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on
        duration formats. Either start-time or cron-spec should be specified.

        *end-time*::: End time of the event. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on
        duration formats.

        Example:

          $ {command} example-policy --schedule=start-time=2019-01-01T00:00:01Z,end-time=2030-01-01T00:00:01Z,cron-job-duration=3600s,cron-spec="10 0 1-7 5 *" --schedule=start-time=2050-01-01T00:00:01Z
