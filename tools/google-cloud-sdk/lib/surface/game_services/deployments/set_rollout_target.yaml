    brief: Set rollout target for the ongoing Deployment rollout in the specified clusters.
    description: |
      Set rollout target for the ongoing Deployment rollout in the specified clusters.

      A Deployment rollout updates game servers with a new image. The new image is specified through
      the spec field of game server template. It is a string field and follows the format of the
      spec field in Agones GameServer custom resource. Please see https://agones.dev for more
      details.

      The new game server template can be specified either through creating a new Deployment
      resource or through the start-rollout verb on an existing Deployment resource
      (`gcloud game-services deployments start-rollout`).

      Once the new game server template is specified, you can start the rollout by changing the
      percentage of game servers that run the new image through the set-rollout-target verb
      (`gcloud game-services deployments set-rollout-target`). The set-rollout-target verb specifies
      labels for clusters that should get the new image. It also specifies what percentage of game
      servers in each of the specified clusters should run the new image.

      Finally, you can finish the rollout using the commit verb
      (`gcloud game-services deployments commit`). This will set the rollout percentage to 100 in
      all clusters whose labels were previously specified by calling the set-rollout-target verb.

      If you need to revert a rollout, you can use the revert-rollout verb
      (`gcloud game-services deployments revert-rollout`) which deletes game servers running the new
      image.
    examples: |
      To set a rollout target with one selector for one cluster label key/value pair:

        $ {command} example-deployment --selector=cluster-labels=label_a=value1,percent=10

      To set a rollout target with multiple selectors, repeat the --selector flag:

        $ {command} example-deployment --selector=cluster-labels=label_a=value1,percent=10 --selector=cluster-labels=label_b=value2,percent=20

      To set a rollout target for with one selector multiple cluster label key/value pairs, you can
      use this syntax:

        $ {command} example-deployment --selector=cluster-labels=^:^"label_a=value1:label_b=value2",percent=20

      Alternatively, you can specify the labels in a YAML file using the `--flags-file` flag:

        $ {command} example-deployment --flags-file="flags.yaml"

      Contents of flags.yaml:

        ```
        - --selector:
            cluster-labels:
                label_a: value1
                label_b: value2
            percent: 10
        - --selector:
            cluster-labels:
                label_c: value3
                label_d: value4
            percent: 20
        ```

        Map representing the percentage of game servers running the new game server template in
        clusters selected by their labels. This flag can be repeated.

        *cluster-labels*::: Key value pairs of labels to use for selecting clusters that should run
        the new game server template.

        *percent*::: Percentage of game servers running the new game server template in the selected
        clusters. The percentage is applied to game server clusters which match any of the specified
        labels. The specified percentage cannot be lower than its current value. Default is 100.
