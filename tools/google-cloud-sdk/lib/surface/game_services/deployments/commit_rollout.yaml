    brief:  Commit the ongoing Deployment rollout.

      Commit the ongoing Deployment rollout.

      A Deployment rollout updates game servers with a new image. The new image is specified through
      the spec field of game server template. It is a string field and follows the format of the
      spec field in Agones GameServer custom resource. Please see https://agones.dev for more
      details.

      The new game server template can be specified either through creating a new Deployment
      resource or through the start-rollout verb on an existing Deployment resource
      (`gcloud game-services deployments start-rollout`).

      Once the new game server template is specified, you can start the rollout by changing the
      percentage of game servers that run the new image through the set-rollout-target verb
      (`gcloud game-services deployments set-rollout-target`). The set-rollout-target verb specifies
      labels for clusters that should get the new image. It also specifies what percentage of game
      servers in each of the specified clusters should run the new image.

      Finally, you can finish the rollout using the commit verb
      (`gcloud game-services deployments commit`). This will set the rollout percentage to 100 in
      all clusters whose labels were previously specified by calling the set-rollout-target verb.

      If you need to revert a rollout, you can use the revert-rollout verb
      (`gcloud game-services deployments revert-rollout`) which deletes game servers running the new
      image.
