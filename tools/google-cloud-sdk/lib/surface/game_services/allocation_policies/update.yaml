    brief: Update an Allocation Policy.
    description: Update a Cloud Game Services Allocation Policy.

  request:

    modify_request_hooks:
    - googlecloudsdk.command_lib.game_services.allocation_policies.update_hooks:MatchClusters

  arguments:
    resource:
      help_text: Cloud Game Services Allocation Policy to update.
      spec: !REF googlecloudsdk.command_lib.game_services.resources:allocation_policy

    params:
    - arg_name: priority
      api_field: allocationPolicy.priority
      help_text: |
        Priority of the Allocation Policy.
    - arg_name: weight
      api_field: allocationPolicy.weight
      help_text: |
        Relative weight of the Allocation Policy.

        If there are multiple policies with the same priority, a policy will
        be selected at random, where the probability of a given policy being
        selected is based on its weight. For example, if there are two
        policies with priority 1, where policy A has weight 100 and policy B
        has weight 300, policy A will be selected 25% of the time, and policy
        B will be selected 75% of the time.
    - arg_name: schedule
      api_field: allocationPolicy.schedules
      help_text: |
        Event schedules. Schedules allow allocation policies to be adjusted for planned events. For
        example, you can add policies to allocate from specific clusters during an event. This flag can
        be repeated.

        The following keys are allowed:

        *cron-spec*::: Cron definition of the scheduled event. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron.
        The cron spec specification is in the local time as defined by the realm. Requires
        cron-job-duration to be specified.

        *cron-job-duration*::: Duration for the cron job event. The duration of the event is effective
        after the cron job's start time. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on
        duration formats. Required if cron-spec is specified.

        *start-time*::: Start time of the event. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on
        duration formats. Either start-time or cron-spec should be specified.

        *end-time*::: End time of the event. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on
        duration formats.

        Example:

          $ {command} example-policy --schedule=start-time=2019-01-01T00:00:01Z,end-time=2030-01-01T00:00:01Z,cron-job-duration=3600s,cron-spec="10 0 1-7 5 *" --schedule=start-time=2050-01-01T00:00:01Z
