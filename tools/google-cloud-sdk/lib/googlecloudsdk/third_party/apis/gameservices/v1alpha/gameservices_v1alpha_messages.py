      AUTHORITY: Either principal or (if present) authority selector.
      ATTRIBUTION: The principal (even if an authority selector is present),
        which must only be used for attribution, not authorization.
      SECURITY_REALM: Any of the security realms in the IAMContext (go
        /security-realms). When used with IN, the condition indicates "any of
        the request's realms match one of the given values; with NOT_IN, "none
        of the realms match any of the given values". Note that a value can

        same  security realm)  - a realm (e.g., 'campus-abc')  - a realm group
        (e.g., 'realms-for-borg-cell-xx', see: go/realm-groups) A match is
        determined by a realm group membership check performed by a
        RealmAclRep object (go/realm-acl-howto). It is not permitted to grant
        access based on the *absence* of a realm, so realm conditions can only

        this request. When used with IN, the condition indicates that one of
        the approvers associated with the request matches the specified
        principal, or is a member of the specified group. Approvers can only
        grant additional access, and are thus only used in a strictly positive
        context (e.g. ALLOW/IN or DENY/NOT_IN).
      JUSTIFICATION_TYPE: What types of justifications have been supplied with
        this request. String values should match enum names from
        security.credentials.JustificationType, e.g. "MANUAL_STRING". It is
        not permitted to grant access based on the *absence* of a
        justification, so justification conditions can only be used in a

        justifications, e.g., a Buganizer ID and a manually-entered reason,
        are normal and supported.
      CREDENTIALS_TYPE: What type of credentials have been supplied with this
        request. String values should match enum names from
        security_loas_l2.CredentialsType - currently, only
        CREDS_TYPE_EMERGENCY is supported. It is not permitted to grant access
