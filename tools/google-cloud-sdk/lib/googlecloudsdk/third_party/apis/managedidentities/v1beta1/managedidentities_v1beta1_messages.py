      SECURITY_REALM: Any of the security realms in the IAMContext (go

        (e.g., 'realms-for-borg-cell-xx', see: go/realm-groups) A match is

      CREDENTIALS_TYPE: What type of credentials have been supplied with this

  different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is

  three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.  You can
  find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API
  Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).

    DetailsValueListEntry: A DetailsValueListEntry object.

  Fields:
    code: The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    details: A list of messages that carry the error details.  There is a
      common set of message types for APIs to use.
    message: A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
      user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
      google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
