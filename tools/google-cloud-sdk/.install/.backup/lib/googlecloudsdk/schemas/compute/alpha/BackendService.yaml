  consistentHash:
    description: |-
      Consistent Hash-based load balancing can be used to provide soft
      session affinity based on HTTP headers, cookies or other properties.
      This load balancing policy is applicable only for HTTP connections.
      The affinity to a particular destination host will be lost when one or
      more hosts are added/removed from the destination service. This field
      specifies parameters that control consistent hashing. This field is
      only applicable when localityLbPolicy is set to MAGLEV or RING_HASH.
      This field is applicable to either:   - A regional backend service
      with the service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2, and
      load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED.  - A global backend
      service with the load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.

      The list of URLs to the HttpHealthCheck or HttpsHealthCheck
      resource for health checking this BackendService. Currently at
      most one health check can be specified, and a health check is
      required for Compute Engine backend services. A health check must
      not be specified for App Engine backend and Cloud Function
      backend.  For internal load balancing, a URL to a HealthCheck
      resource must be specified instead.

      [Output Only] Type of resource. Always compute#backendService
      for backend services.
    type: string
  loadBalancingScheme:
    description: |-
      Indicates whether the backend service will be used with
      internal or external load balancing. A backend service created
      for one type of load balancing cannot be used with the other.
      Possible values are INTERNAL and EXTERNAL.
    type: string
    enum:
    - EXTERNAL
    - INTERNAL
    - INTERNAL_MANAGED

  localityLbPolicy:
    description: |-
      The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the
      locality. The possible values are:   - ROUND_ROBIN: This is a
      simple policy in which each healthy backend is selected in
      round robin order. This is the default.  - LEAST_REQUEST: An
      O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy hosts and
      picks the host which has fewer active requests.  - RING_HASH:
      The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
      hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
      addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
      1/N of the requests.  - RANDOM: The load balancer selects a
      random healthy host.  -
    type: string
    enum:
    - INVALID_LB_POLICY

    description: |-
      Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource
      is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply
      with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters
      long and match the regular expression
      `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character
      must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
      character, which cannot be a dash.
