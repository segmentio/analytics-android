## Contributing / Adding Providers

#### Build via Gradle

To build the project with [Gradle](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/user-guide), you will need to install the Android SDK and set a variable `$ANDROID_HOME` to point to its install location.
You'll also need to open the SDK Manager tool and install the right SDK version of Android (API 19) and the right version of the build tools (19.1.0).

Once you have set all this up, run `./gradlew tasks --all` to see all available tasks.
Runing `./gradlew clean build connectedTest` will run all the tests. Note that you'll need to have a connected device or emulator for tests.

Check out how to contribute to the library, or add providers here: [https://segment.io/libraries/android#contributing](https://segment.io/libraries/android#contributing).
