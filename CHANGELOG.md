Version 4.2.4 (November 13th, 2016)
====================================
 * [Fix] Revert relying on HTTP Cache for cache settings introduced in 4.2.2 to avoid interfering
 with application level cache behavior.
 

Version 4.2.3 (November 4th, 2016)
====================================
 * Update cdn hostname from `cdn.segment.com` to `cdn-settings.segment.com`.


Version 4.2.2 (October 13th, 2016)
====================================

  * [Fix](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-android/pull/479): Rely on HTTP cache for caching settings responses. This fixes a regression introduced in [version 4.1.4](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-android/pull/448), where cached settings responses were not being used, and would always be fetched from the network.


Version 4.2.1 (October 7th, 2016)
====================================

  * [Fix](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-android/pull/476): Use Application Opened instead of Application Started.
  * [Improvement](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-android/pull/475): Update Google Play Services for Android wear module.

Version 4.2.0 (September 19th, 2016)
====================================

  * [Improvement](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-android/pull/464): Reduce synthetic accessor methods.
  * [Fix](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-android/pull/466): Handle `null` values in maps.
  * [New](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-android/pull/467): Add the ability for the SDK to natively report attribution information via Segment integrations enabled for your project, without needing to bundle their SDKs. Attribution information is sent as a track call as documented in the [mobile lifecycle spec](https://segment.com/docs/spec/mobile/#install-attributed).

```java
Analytics analytics = new Analytics.Builder(context, writeKey)
    .trackAttributionInformation()
    .build();
```

Version 4.1.6 (August 9th, 2016)
================================

  * Improvement: Add more logging when collecting advertising ID.

Version 4.1.5 (July 10th, 2016)
===============================

  * Improvement: Add more protection against growing disk queue to over 2GB.

Version 4.1.4 (Jun 6th, 2016)
=============================

  * New: Add opt out method in the library. This will stop sending any events to all integrations for the device.

```java
analytics.optOut(true);
```

  * Fix: Use Application Opened instead of Application Started.
  * Improvement: gzip HTTP request body.
  * Fix: Guard against possible ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

Version 4.1.3 (May 31st, 2016)
==============================

  * Fix: Early Return when queue error occurs
  * Fix: Don't block user thread while waiting for advertising ID
  * Fix: Add Memory Fallback and be lenient about Queue Errors.

Version 4.1.2 (May 24th, 2016)
==============================

  * Fix: Wait for advertising ID to be ready before enqueuing events.
  * New: Instrument automatic screen tracking. Enable this during initialization.

```java
Analytics analytics = new Analytics.Builder(context, writeKey)
    .recordScreenViews()
    .build();
```

Version 4.1.1 (May 10th, 2016)
==============================

  * Fix: Handling how advertising information is collected. Previously, if `isLimitAdTracking` was true, the library would incorrectly record it as `adTrackingEnabled: true`, when it should have been `adTrackingEnabled: false`. A server side fix has been deployed to automatically correct this. However, we still recommend customers update to the latest version.

Version 4.1.0 (May 9th, 2016)
==============================

  * New: Instrument automatic application lifecycle event tracking. Enable this during initialization.

```java
Analytics analytics = new Analytics.Builder(context, writeKey)
    .trackApplicationLifecycleEvents()
    .build();
```

  * Fix: Dump raw QueueFile data to track #321.

Version 4.0.9 (Mar 29th, 2016)
==============================

  * Fix: Fix for possible race condition when mutating integration options on multiple threads.

Version 4.0.8 (Mar 15th, 2016)
==============================

  * Fix: Another update to `Options` handling, so that it can *not* override the tracking plan if an event is disabled.

Version 4.0.7 (Mar 14th, 2016)
==============================

  * Fix: Handle possible NPE introduced in 4.0.6.

Version 4.0.6 (Mar 14th, 2016)

  * New: Improve logging information for QueueFile.

Version 4.0.3 (Dec 29th, 2015)

Version 4.0.2 (Dec 11th, 2015)
==============================

  * Fix: Actually fix NPE when device is offline duNring initialization.

Version 4.0.1 (Dec 7th, 2015)
==============================

  * Fix: NPE when device is offline during initialization.

Version 4.0.0 (Nov 24th, 2015)
==============================

  * Deprecates `analytics-core` artifact. This is now renamed into the `analytics` artifact.
  * Bundling integrations is now more explicit. It takes 2 steps:

Add the integration dependencies.
```
  compile('com.segment.analytics.android.integrations:google-analytics:1.0.0') {
    transitive = true
  }
  compile('io.branch.segment.analytics.android.integrations:library:1.0.0-RELEASE') {
    transitive = true
  }
  ...
```

Register them in your builder when you initialize the SDK.
```
Analytics analytics = new Analytics.Builder(context, writeKey)
  .use(GoogleAnalyticsIntegration.FACTORY)
  .use(BranchIntegration.FACTORY)
  ...
  .build();
```

Version 3.4.0 (Oct 20th, 2015)
==============================

  * Updating Amplitude SDK to 2.2.0
  * New Logging API for integrations
     * Integrations will log the exact method call made by them, which makes it easier to see
       exactly how a Segment call is translated for the end tool.
       Currently only done for a few tools (Mixpanel, Google Analytics, Flurry, Localytics),
       but will be added for more tools.
     * LogLevel.BASIC is now deprecated. Use LogLevel.DEBUG instead.
     * Logging behaviour with regards to bundled integrations has changed. See the JavaDocs
       for more details.
